    <p class="centered-subtitle">
      Ruinart’s relationship with Art is historically rooted. Founded in the Age of Enlightenment, in a world of ideas,
      exchanges, and culture, the Maison has never stopped developing and promoting an art of living that is dear to it.

    <p class="content-paragraph">
      Ruinart has a longstanding relationship with the world of Art. Demonstrating audacity and innovation
      in its choices, the Maison commissioned the Czech artist Alphonse Mucha to design its first advertisement
      in 1896. Exhibited from the Morris columns in Paris to the summit of the Mont Blanc, the poster created a
      sensation. The artist then became the leading figure of the Art Nouveau movement.
      <br><br>
      The connection between Ruinart and art has remained strong ever since, maintaining close links with contemporary
      art. The Maison regularly commissions the artists of its time to share their vision on its legacy.

        Trustful that art can enlighten and connect us, Ruinart gives Carte Blanche to leading contemporary artists to pay tribute to the Maison’s legacy.
        <br><br>
        Chosen for their commitments to sustainability, the artists are invited to Reims for an immersive journey to discover the Maison, its vineyards and its Crayères. They then share their vision of the work in the vineyards and the elaboration of the wines. Their artworks echo Ruinart’s values, raising awareness about climate change.
        <br><br>
        Since 2008, Ruinart has established 12 Carte Blanche projects. In 2021, the artist David Shrigley, who is used to observe his surroundings with incomparable irony, fixes his gaze upon the longstanding Maison through a set of 42 works.
