      <hr class="divider">
      <p class="content-paragraph">
        Dom Thierry Ruinart was an intuitive, visionary, hardworking, and modest Benedictine monk who lived from 1657-1709 and was a contemporary of Louis XIV.
        <br><br>
        A brilliant theologian and historian, at the age of 23 he left his home in Champagne to go to the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés, one of the most influential centres of learning near Paris.
        <br><br>
        While there, he was exposed to the city and court where he gained an awareness of a more worldly life. Specifically, he learned of a new “wine with bubbles,” not yet known as champagne, which was already popular among young aristocrats.

          <p class="content-paragraph">
            On September 1st 1729, in Reims, at the heart of the Champagne region, Nicolas Ruinart drafted the founding charter of Maison Ruinart, creating the world's first ever champagne-producing company.
            <br><br>
              This gave rise to an enterprise that continues to flourish and to prosper nearly three hundred years later.
            <br><br>
              The intuition of his uncle, the monk who had first shown him the way, had thus inspired an initiative that was to make history.
